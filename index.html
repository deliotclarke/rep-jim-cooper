            <h3 class="uline top">About Jim:</h3>
                <p>Congressman Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha, his wife of thirty-three years, live in Nashville and have three children.<br><br>
                A New York Times columnist called him "the House's conscience, a lonely voice for civility in this ugly era" and a "tart-tongued moderate" who "seeks bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other issues in a polarized political climate." USA Today named him one of the "Brave 38" of a "tiny band of heroes" in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan.<br><br>
                In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform. He's also a businessman, attorney and part-time Vanderbilt professor when Congress is not in session.</p>
            <h3 class="uline">About District 5:</h3>
                <p>The 5th Congressional District of Tennessee includes all of Davidson County and Dickson County, and part of Cheatham County. Over 700,000 people live in both rural and urban areas in the heart of Middle Tennessee.</p>
